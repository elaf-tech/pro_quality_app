# Rule: Avoid using `var`

You are working on the pro_quality_app project. We have a strict rule to avoid using the `var` keyword to ensure type safety and code clarity.

Always use explicit types (`String`, `int`, `List`, etc.) or `final` for variables.

## ❌ FORBIDDEN

Do not use `var` to declare variables.

```dart
// ❌ FORBIDDEN
var name = 'Manus';
var age = 1;
