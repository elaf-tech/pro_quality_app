# Security Standards

## Data Protection
- **NO Secrets in Git**: API Keys, Tokens, Passwords must NOT be committed. use `.env`.
- **Secure Storage**: Use `flutter_secure_storage` for saving tokens/credentials locally. Never `SharedPreferences` for sensitive data.

## Network
- **HTTPS Only**: All traffic must be encrypted.
- **Certificate Pinning**: Recommended for high-security modules.

## Input Validation
- Validate all user inputs (forms, params) before sending to API.
- Sanitize inputs to prevent injection attacks (though less common in Flutter, logic flaws exist).
