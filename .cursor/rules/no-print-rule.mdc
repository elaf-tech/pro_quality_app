# Rule: Use `developer.log` instead of `print`

In the pro_quality_app project, we avoid using `print()` because it's hard to track and can be accidentally left in production code.

For all debugging output, you must use `log()` from the `dart:developer` library.

## ❌ FORBIDDEN

Do not use `print()` for any debugging output.

```dart
// ❌ FORBIDDEN
print('An error occurred');
print('User data: $user');
