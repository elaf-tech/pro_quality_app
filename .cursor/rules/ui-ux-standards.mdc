# UI/UX Standards

## Architecture
- **Pattern**: GetX (Controller -> View -> Binding).
- **Separation**: Logic in Controllers, UI in Views.

## Responsive Design
- Support various screen sizes.
- Use `LayoutBuilder` or responsive wrappers/packages.

## Accessibility
- Add `semanticsLabel` to critical components.
- Ensure touch targets are at least 48x48.

## Performance in UI
- Avoid `Opacity` widget for animations (expensive), use `AnimatedOpacity`.
- Use `const` for static icons/text.
